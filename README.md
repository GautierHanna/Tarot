# French Tarot (code in french)

Here, my goal is to create a Tarot's game from scratch.

# Achieved

The distribution, rules and the scoring's (to complete with the extra bonuses) functions

# To do 

1) The bidding (probably using an algorithm of supervised learning)
2) The strategy for dog's desk (again, with some kind of sup. learning or Gen. Alg.)

# To explore 

1) Using a Neural Network in order to learn the strategy to win
2) Using Reinforcement Learning and compare.
